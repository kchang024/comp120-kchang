            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Kevin, I'm a security consultant who was hired 
            to resolve security and privacy issues for notUber, a ride-hailing 
            service. <br/>This ride-hailing service has many different 
            functions, they are:
            <ul>
                <li>Provides a /rides API (POST) that allows 
                people looking for rides to enter their name, latitude and 
                longitude and gives that POST request a list of available
                notUber vehicles available for a ride.</li>

                <li>Provides a /update API (POST) that allows the 
                notUber driver vehicles to update their 
                availability for picking up passengers. Accepts username,
                latitude, longitude.</li>

                <li>Provides a /passenger.json API (GET) that accepts 
                a passenger's username and displays all the database records 
                for that username.</li>

                <li>Provides a /vehicle.json API (GET) that accepts a 
                notUber driver's username and displays all the database 
                records for that username.</li>

                <li>Provides an index page that displays all passengers's 
                requests for notUber service.</li>
            </ul></p>
            
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Tools: Curl<br/>
            The tool I used was Curl and the methods of attack were SQL 
            injection and Cross-Site scripting XSS via the browser/command line.
            </p><br/>

            <p> SQL injection vulerability detected - Two issues found using 
            SQL injection:<br/>By inserting '+OR+1=1-- into the GET request 
            for passengers; like so: </p>

            <xmp>https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/passenger.json?username=Kevin'+OR+1=1-- </xmp>

            <p>What results in the SQL query will return all passenger's 
            database records where the username is Kevin or 1 is equal to 1. 
            <br/>Since 1 = 1 will always be true, this SQL query will return 
            all passenger database records regardless of the username given. 
            <br/> <br/>Similarly this can be done with the GET request for vehicles; 
            like so:</p> 

            <xmp> https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/vehicle.json?username=Kevin'+OR+1=1-- </xmp> 
            <p>This will display all vehicle's database records regardless of 
            what the username given is.</p><br/>
            <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability detected - <br/> 
            The 2 POST APIs allow the users to insert their usernames 
            into the databases of passengers or vehicles without any measures 
            to protect against XSS. <br/> I tested this by injecting javascript 
            code via this Curl 
            command: <xmp>curl --data "username=<body onload=alert('HACKED')>&lat=40.2&lng=-70" https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/rides</xmp>

            <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
            <p>HIGH LEVEL OF URGENCY NEEDED.<br/>Four major vulnerabilities 
            were found in the system using 2 different methods of testing 
            the system.<br/>These 2 security risks are known as SQL injection 
            and Cross-Site Scripting XSS, both in the top 10 web application 
            security risks. You can learn more here: 
            <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OSWASP TOP TEN</a>
            <br/>The security of our database is in question, 
            we risk exposing passenger and notUber driver's vehicle records. 
            (SQL injection)<br/>We also risk the functionality of our site and 
            exposing visitors to our site to potential harm and danger. <br/>
            If an attacker wanted to they could manipulate our website in a way 
            where sensitive data can get sent to them about visitors to our 
            site without them even knowing. (XSS)<br/>

            <h2>Issues Found</h2>
            
                <p class="issue">Issue #1</p>

                <p class="issuesCat">Issue:</p>
                <p>SQL Injection vulnerability - <br/> adding ‘+OR+1=1-- to the 
                URL request after the username field
                https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/passenger.json?
                username=Kevin'27+OR+1=1-- 
                (see description below for more details)</p>
                
                <p class="issuesCat">Location/page where issue was found:</p>

                <p>/passenger.json code, starting at line 76</p>
                    
                <p class="issuesCat">Severity of issue (low, med, high):</p>
                <p>HIGH! <br/>App intended to only be able to look at records of
                a given username, out of privacy reasons being able to access 
                records you shouldn’t have access to, is a high severity. <br/>
                SQL injections overall is a high risk method of attack, 
                #1 on OWASP Top 10.</p>

                <p class="issuesCat">Description of issue:</p>
                <p> The app should only be able to retrieve a list of all 
                    passenger records when given a specific username. 
                    If that username isn’t found, an empty list should return.
                    Thus users of this app should have only been able to 
                    retrieve a passenger’s records if they know the username.
                    By doing a SQL injection attack, were able to retrieve 
                    records of all passengers without knowing a specific 
                    username.</p>

                    alt="screenshot of issue1"/></p>

                <p class="issuesCat">Resolution:</p>
                <p> Don't use dynamic SQL where you construct queries using user 
                    input instead use prepared statements, parameterized queries 
                    or stored procedures. See code below:

                    else {
                        client.query(‘SELECT * FROM passengers WHERE username = ?’, [usernameEntry], (error, result) => {
                            if (!error) {
                                response.send(result.rows);
                            }
                        });
                    }
                    </xmp>

                <p class="issuesCat">Resolution:</p>
                <p>Similarly to issue #1's resolution, don't use dynamic SQL 
                    where you construct queries using user input instead use 
                    prepared statements, parameterized queries or stored 
                    procedures. See code below:
<xmp>
    else {
        client.query(‘SELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE username = ?’, [usernameEntry], (error, result) => {
            if (!error) {
                response.send(result.rows);
            }
        });
    }
</xmp>

<p class="issue">Issue #3</p>

                <p class="issuesCat">Issue:</p>
                <p>Cross-Site Scripting XSS vulnerability - <br/> adding JavaScript code to the 
                username field instead of an username: 
                <xmp>curl --data "username=<body onload=alert('HACKED')>&lat=40.2&lng=-70" https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/rides </xmp>
                (see description below for more details)</p>
                
                <p class="issuesCat">Location/page where issue was found:</p>

                <p>/rides code, starting at line 16</p>
                    
                <p class="issuesCat">Severity of issue (low, med, high):</p>
                <p>HIGH! <br/>Username inputs aren’t being validated. Thus the 
                user is able to include JavaScript into the username input. 
                When the input is later sent as a response in the (‘/‘) 
                index page it will run whatever javascript was inserted into the 
                username table. This has the potential to cause very deadly 
                effects to the database.</p>

                <p class="issuesCat">Description of issue:</p>
                <p> Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was detected - hackers 
                have the ability to add javascript to the username field in the 
                HTTP POST request- this code is later sent as a http response on 
                the index page we were able to manipulate the database username 
                field with javascript. See picture below</p>

                <p class="issuesCat">Proof of vulnerability:</p>
                <p id="issuePic"><img src="issue3.png"  
                    alt="screenshot of issue3"/></p>

                <p class="issuesCat">Resolution:</p>
                <p> One resolution is to use a validator to validate the user's 
                    input for the username. One important lesson a wise teacher
                    once taught me: NEVER TRUST USER INPUT!!!
                    Set it so that the username only accepts alphanumeric 
                    characters, no symbols. We can add additional 
                    conditional checks before we process the client.query
                    in app.post. Since this server already has the validator 
                    addon we can use that. On line 23 add the following to the 
                    if statement:

                <xmp>&& validator.isAlphanumeric(username);</xmp>
</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>I would recommend a HIGH level of urgency in fixing these issues.
            If possible cease all website functionality until these 
            vulnerabilities have been patched.<br/>I would recommend a thorough 
            penetration test for any newly created web apps.<br/>Potentially 
            hiring a web security developer/officer to oversee future web 
            security operations. <br/>There is also software services that can 
            help detect vulnerabilities in web apps. <br/>Application services 
            such as Burp Suite can allow users/companies to secure their apps 
            from any vulnerabilities.<br/>Burp suite has a lot of powerful tools 
            used for penetration testing.<br/>Burp suite offers enterprise 
            automated protection for $3,999 per year.<br/>If you do hire a web 
            security officer Burp suite offers their professional 
            tool suite for professional penetration testers for $399/per 
            user per year.</p>
