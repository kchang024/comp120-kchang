        Correct Implementation/ Incorrect Implementation:
	        I'm not sure if the formatting of the page is what was wanted.
            My messages are on the same line. 

            I tried formatting it a few ways, but it seems like when
            I tried making a newline in javascript a few different ways using 
            \n but it didn't seem to work.
            
            For example - I tried writing out a string 
            for the innerHTML "hi \n hi", the newLine wasn't captured.

            I also tried concatenating a long string using innerHTML to display
            and same issue as above.

            Creating a node that holds "\n" and appending that didn't 
            seem to work either. This only gave me a "space".

            Is this what you meant by not to worry about styling until
            next week?

        Acknowledgements/collaborated:
